## Roux / Data for Social Good Project Proposal: Portland Public Schools

**Date:** October 30, 2024

This Roux / Data for Social Good (DSG) Project would support the implementation of Portland Public School's (PPS) new 5-year Strategic Plan. It would focus on the development of leading metrics for each of the plan's five Strategic Priorities:

- **Equity** - *Keeping Equity at the Center*
- **Achievement** - *Enhancing Academic Excellence and Equity*
- **Whole Student** - *Cultivating Inclusivity and Belonging*
- **People** - *Developing Staff, Leaders, and Organizational Culture*
- **Systems** - *Streamlining Operations for Equity, Efficacy, and Accountability*

### Project Overview

PPS would use leading metrics for monitoring progress towards the strategic priorities on a quarterly basis. In this project, the terms *leading metrics* and *leading indicators* are treated as synonymous, though leading metrics can also be thought of as the measurement of leading indicators. 

**Definition:** Leading metrics in the education sector are "indicators that provide early signals of progress toward academic achievement."ยน This definition is broadened to include "early signals of progress toward" the successful implementation of the Strategic Plan, which includes initiatives for students, staff, and administrative systems. This contrasts with lagging metrics, such as student State assessment scores, staff retention, or annual budget variance.

### Project Context

**Strategic Plan Priority:** Systems - 2024/25 Focus #1: "Design and implement the data infrastructure necessary to build dashboards to monitor progress of the school system effectively."

**Key Personnel:**
- **PPS Point Person:** Hayley Didriksen, Senior Director of Data and Assessment
- **Project Lead:** Scott Barksdale, Roux Analytics student and former school leader

### Project Phases

This three-stage project spans approximately 7 months with clearly defined deliverables and hand-offs at the end of each stage.

## Phase 1: Metrics Research and Development
**Timeline:** November - January

### Key Tasks:
- Develop understanding of District's current and proposed data sources and capacities
- Determine which data sources could be used in existing form, which would require imputation of missing data, and/or which could benefit from the creation of synthetic datasets
- Develop plan to mask Personally Identifiable Information or other sensitive or confidential data
- Build research base of effective practices for developing and using leading metrics in the education sector
- Develop multiple leading metrics for each of the strategic priorities for annual, semiannual, or quarterly monitoring

### Deliverables & Hand-offs:
- Data sources inventory (reviewed and updated if already exists)
- Description of data infrastructure that exists and is under development
- Key readings from the literature about development and use of leading metrics by schools and districts
- Proposal for imputing missing data or creating synthetic datasets
- Plan for maintaining confidentiality
- **Two or more proposed metrics for each of the five strategic priorities**

*Hand-off: DSG team membership re-opens in January after deliverables completed. SB continues as team lead.*

### Key Questions:
- Who are the primary users of the leading metrics and who is their audience?
- What level of data literacy do these groups have?
- **Whose voice/voices need to be heard in order to determine if progress is being made in each Strategic Priority?**
- What is the availability of historical data?
- What data sources are being adjusted, refined, or newly developed this year?
- What is the scope of the data being reviewed?
- **What do the primary users want to be able to do with the metrics that are developed?**

## Phase 2: Analytics Framework, Statistical Methods, and Data Visualization Development
**Timeline:** February - June

### Key Tasks:
- Communicate strengths and limitations of each metric
- Propose statistical, analytical, and data visualization methods best suited for the metrics and for the PPS context
- Create three prototypes: one for student-focused strategic priority, one for staff-focused strategic priority, and one for systems-focused strategic priority, all using anonymized PPS data or synthesized (non-PPS) data

### Deliverables & Hand-offs:
- Suggested statistical, analytic, and visualization methods for each proposed metric
- One prototype per strategic priority, including statistical tests, analytic methods, supporting code, and data visualization

*Hand-off: DSG team to PPS*

### Key Questions:
- What coding language(s) do PPS data analysts use?
- What kinds of inferences are - and are not - valid for each prototype?
- What are 2-3 next steps or additional areas to research?

## Phase 3: Follow-Up / Implementation Support
**Timeline:** July

### Key Tasks:
- Support PPS in understanding, selecting, refining, and implementing proposed metrics and methods
- Outline of potential projects and priorities that could be continued by a future Roux XN Project or Roux Co-op

### Deliverables & Hand-offs:
- Documentation of selected metrics reflecting any additional refinement or implementation requirements

*Hand-off: SB to PPS point person*

### Key Questions:
- Going forward, who will be leading this work?
- What additional training or resources are required to sustain the work? How can the Roux support?
- Going forward, who will be completing the technical components of this work? What do they need in order to continue this work?
- Do decision-makers need additional support or materials to most effectively use the developed metrics?
